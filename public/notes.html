                    <h3>How to Play?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Playing D&D can be very fun, but getting started can be difficult. 
                        This note will hopefully make the process of playing much more straightforward; this does not mean you need to follow any particular rule, though. 
                        D&D is meant to be a fun experience, and if something is preventing you from having fun, talk with your Dungeon Master and see what you can do. 
                        The first step to playing is finding a group to play with. 
                        Dungeon Crafters Guide does host limited community functions but is primarily a personal site for you. 
                        Dungeon Crafters Guide is a site where you can store character sheets and plan for your campaign. 
                        The site does hold the capability to relieve some stress from the character sheet-making process. 
                        When you insert your base stats, the site will auto-fill the rest of the information that would be needed later. 
                        This function can be overridden as changes happen to your character over time.
                        You can roll for your stats very quickly if you have 4D6. 
                        You can roll them and drop the lowest of the four; this is a customary rule but may change if your campaign or Dungeon Master says otherwise. 
                        Remember, this beautiful game has no set rules. 
                        Have as much fun as you can with it.

                    <h3>How to Run a Campaign?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that you are considering making a campaign, you should know a few things. 
                        Creating a campaign will take a lot of time away from other activities, depending on the level of detail you wish to add. 
                        Not much detail is needed, but here are a few things that will help. 
                        Name generators are a big help as you must keep track of players and NPC (non-player characters). 
                        Having a resource like this will take some burden off your shoulders as other parts take more dedication. 
                        Making a map isn't necessary but can add interest in the world you create. 
                        Note that your campaign does not have to be original. 
                        Many Dungeon Masters run D&D source campaigns, which is an excellent place to start as they have a general story and world already planned. 
                        The most important thing to remember is to consider the moderation at which you build. Getting burned out is a severe issue for new DMs'. 
                        This can all be avoided by understanding what you and your players want from your campaign. 
                        Remember, this is supposed to be fun, so don't make it over-complicated.
